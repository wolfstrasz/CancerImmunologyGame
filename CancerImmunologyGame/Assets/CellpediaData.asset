    cellname: T Killer cell
    description: "When T Killer cells like you are given the license to act by Dendritic
      cells, they gain the ability to see \u2018breadcrumb trails \u2019 of chemokines.
      These direct them to the source of danger. When they find the cell that is
      the source of danger, T Killer cells spit little granules that act like tiny
      missiles, damaging the surface of their target, resulting in the death of their
      target cell."

    cellname: T Helper cell
    description: Everybody needs a helping hand once in a while! As their name suggest,
      T Helper cells are a kind of T cell that help other immune cells. They do this
      by releasing litter molecular messages called cytokines. When other immune
      cells pick up these cytokines, their behaviour is altered depending on the
      content of the message (e.g. cytokines can make other immune cells multiple,
      or can tell them to change into a different cell type).

      for intruders or signs of danger in every corner of the body. When they spot
      something, the move to the lymph node, where they present evidence of their
      findings to T cells. If a T cell recognises the evidence too, it becomes activated,
      gaining \u2018license \u2019 to begin performing its function."

    cellname: T Regulatory cell
    description: "T Regulatory cells are super important in the body since they have
      the ability to tell other immune cells to stop what they are doing. This role
      is crucial in preventing immune cells from accidentally attacking the body,
      which would result into autoimmunity. However T Regulatory cells can be \u2018bribed
      \u2019 to protect cancer cells from immune attack. This makes T Regulatory
      cells an interesting cell: both friend and foe depending on the scenario!\r\n"

    cellname: Cancer cells
    description: "The ability that cancer cells have to follow conventional rules
      followed by other cells is the result of damage to the genetic instructions
      (genes) that dictate how and when our cells divide. These \u2018damages \u2019
      are called mutations. Many factors can lead to mutations in genes, although
      not all mutations are bad or cause diseases. Some are inherited from our parents,
      or they can appear early only in life from mistakes that occur when cells divide.
      Other mutations are the result of influences from the environment. These are
      well known and can include cigarettes, alcohol and exposure to radiation such
      as UV radiation from the sun."

    cellname: Cancer Associated Fibroblast
    description: Fibroblasts usually help wounds heal. Around cancer, fibroblasts
      can become corrupt, giving cancer an advantage. These corupted cells are termed
      Cancer Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs release proteins and other structural
      molecules that construct a dense and rigid web around the cells called extracellular
      matrix. The matrix shields them and make it more difficult for T Killer cells
      to do their job! For this reason, CAFs are currently being extensively researched
      to see if we can target CAFs to improve survival in cancer patients.
