  description: "\u2018Cancer\u2019 is the term given to a wide range of different
    diseases; in general, all of these diseases comprise cells that ignore conventional
    rules followed by normal cells. This ability is the result of mutations in the
    genetic instructions of cells. The result: cancer cells divide in an uncontrolled
    fashion, allowing cancer cells to spread into surrounding areas of the body,
    generally causing damage on the way."
