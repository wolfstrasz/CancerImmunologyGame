  description: 'Fibroblasts usually help heal wounds. During cancer, they can become
    corrupted, behaving in ways that give cancer an advantage. These cells are termed
    cancer associated fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs release proteins and other structural
    molecules that construct a dense and rigid web around the cancer called the extracellular
    matrix. This stiff matrix shields the cancer from immune cells, making it more
    difficult for T killer to do their job! For this reason, CAFs are currently being
    extensively researched to see if we can target CAFs to improve survival in cancer
    patients. '
