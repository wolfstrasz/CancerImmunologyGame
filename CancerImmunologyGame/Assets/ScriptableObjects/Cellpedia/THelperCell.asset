  description: Everybody needs a helping hand once in a while! As their name suggest,
    T helper cells are a kind of T cell that help other immune cells. They do this
    by releasing litter molecular messages called cytokines. When other immune cells
    pick up these cytokines, their behaviour is altered depending on the content
    of the message (e.g. cytokines can make other immune cells multiple, or can tell
    them to change into a different cell type).
