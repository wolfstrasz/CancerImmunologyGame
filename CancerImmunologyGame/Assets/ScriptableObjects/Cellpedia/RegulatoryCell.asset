  description: "T regulatory cells are super important in the body since they have
    the ability to tell other immune cells to stop what they are doing. This role
    is crucial in preventing immune cells from accidentally attacking the body, which
    would result in autoimmunity. However,\r\nT regulatory cells can be \u2018bribed\u2019
    to protect cancer cells from immune attack. This makes T regulatory cells an
    interesting cell: both friend and foe depending on the scenario!\r"
