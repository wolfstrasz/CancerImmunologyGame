  description: Fibroblasts usually help wounds heal. Around cancer, fibroblasts can
    become corrupt, giving cancer an advantage. These corupted cells are termed Cancer
    Associated Fibroblasts (CAFs). CAFs release proteins and other structural molecules
    that construct a dense and rigid web around the cells called extracellular matrix.
    The matrix shields them and make it more difficult for T Killer cells to do their
    job! For this reason, CAFs are currently being extensively researched to see
    if we can target CAFs to improve survival in cancer patients.
