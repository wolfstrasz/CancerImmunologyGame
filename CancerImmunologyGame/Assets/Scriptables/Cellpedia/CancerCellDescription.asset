  description: "The ability that cancer cells have to follow conventional rules followed
    by other cells is the result of damage to the genetic instructions (genes) that
    dictate how and when our cells divide. These \u2018damages \u2019 are called
    mutations. Many factors can lead to mutations in genes, although not all mutations
    are bad or cause diseases. Some are inherited from our parents, or they can appear
    early only in life from mistakes that occur when cells divide. Other mutations
    are the result of influences from the environment. These are well known and can
    include cigarettes, alcohol and exposure to radiation such as UV radiation from
    the sun."
